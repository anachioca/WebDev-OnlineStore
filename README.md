## Project Description:

The following diagram shows how our website works:

![diagrama](./img/web_diagram3.png)

#### Navbar
The navbar appears in every page of our application, and was made using Bootstrap's navbar component. A specific stylesheet was used to apply different colors to the navbar. 

#### Admin Page
This page (admin.html) is shown when the administrator is logged in and now he can access new functionalities.
This user can manage the available products, manage the current promotions and manage the users (clientes) that are cadastrated on the plataform. He can remove them and see their buying history.
There he can normally access all the other pages, but, of course, has some of the privilegies told before.

#### Login Page
In this page the user can login the website's system using a registerd email and password. After connected the user will be redirected to the main page, if logged with a client account, or to admin page if logged with an admin account.<br>
If the user doesn't have a registerd account, from this page he can access the register page.

#### Products Page
This page shows all the products available in our online shop. If the client clicks the "produtos" button in the navbar, they are redirected to this page. If they click another button, such as "acess√≥rios" or "terra", they will be redirected to the same products page, but a filter will be applied (in the next milestone of the project). The products page was built using Bootstrap's cards and grid system.

#### Main Page
The main page is responsive, and the background image changes according to the size of the screen.

#### Other pages
Some other pages will be made for this project, such as the cart page, which will list all the products chosen by the user, the user page, in which the user will be able to change it's infos (name, password, etc), and the admin page, in which the admin of the website can manage the products and users.
